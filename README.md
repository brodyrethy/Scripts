# scripts
Assorted Bash and Python scripts I wrote. All for (Arch) Linux. Let it be known that I use Arch btw.

- Arch post-installer
- Mount ext4/LUKS drive
- Randomize wallpaper
- ... And many more.

Currently converting my Python scripts to Bash. Python is unnecessary for scripting. I still like Python, but prefer to reserve it only when I can't do something in Bash effectively.
