# scripts
Some scripts for (Arch) Linux I've written over the years. Let it be known that I use Arch btw. If a script isn't important enough for it's own repository, it goes here.

- Brody's Post-installation Script for Arch
- Mount LUKS USB
- Mount USB
- Randomize wallpaper
- dwm status bar
- obbar
- ... And many more.

Right now, scripts are written in Python, others written in Bash, but I am currently converting my Python scripts to Bash. Python is just too heavy for scripting. I'd prefer not to subject my system to that. I still like Python, but prefer to reserve it for "heavier" programming.
